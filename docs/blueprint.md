# **App Name**: SkillDock

## Core Features:

- Profile Creation: Enable users to create profiles with basic info (name, location), skills offered, skills wanted, and availability.
- Skill Listing: Allow users to list the skills they can offer and the skills they need, as well as the desired days and times for swapping.
- User Search: Implement search functionality to find other users by skill, and to filter public or private profiles.
- Swap Requests: Implement a system for requesting, accepting, and deleting skill swaps.
- Feedback System: Provide a rating and feedback mechanism to the users after a skill swap has occurred.
- Content Moderation Tool: In the admin panel, implement an AI tool that moderates and categorizes skills and monitors user's posted swap request text content, flagging inappropriate content for review.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and competence, reflecting the nature of professional skill-sharing.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#ECEFF1) for a calm, neutral backdrop that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#7E57C2), for interactive elements and subtle highlights, contrasting subtly with the primary blue.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings, giving a modern, geometric and professional touch; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, making reading easy.
- Use a set of clean, professional icons to represent different skills and categories.
- A clean and intuitive layout is proposed. The MVP will focus on the core flows only (browsing/requesting), optimizing ease of use over advanced or complex display options.
- Subtle transition animations when loading and filtering data, to provide feedback on interactions.
